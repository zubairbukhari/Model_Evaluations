# Model_Evaluations
The best answer to the question "how should I select the best model" is to always try all the models conditionally. Here in this little piece of work, I deployed all the regression models on a real world data set of "combined cycle powerplant" which I got from the UCI machine learning repository to check the model performance and to evaluate which one is the best for the selected data set. The selection was based on the coefficient r squared or adjusted r squared. The dependent variable vector y which is predicted by the models in this data set is the Energy Output of a powerplant with the other features (i.e, Ambient Temperature, Volume, Ambient Pressure and Relative Humidity). I efficiently deployed the regression models on this dataset to qucikly identify and select the best regression model for this particular dataset.
